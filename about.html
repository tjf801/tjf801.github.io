		<h4 class="text">Intro</h4>
		<p class="text">Hi! I am Tyler Fusco, a Computer Science/Engineering student in the UCONN class of 2026. I have been programming in some capacity for around eight years now<!--since late 2015-->, mostly focusing on personal projects in python, Rust, and C; However, this year I have started to do some basic web development. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, listening to music, skiing, playing video games, and procrastinating on actually commiting my code to github.</p>
