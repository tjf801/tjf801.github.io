		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>Tyler Fusco</h2>
		
		<h4>Intro</h4>
		<p>Hi! I am Tyler Fusco, also known as tjf801, a Computer Science/Engineering student in the UCONN class of 2026. I have been programming in some capacity for around seven years now<!--since late 2015-->, mostly focusing on personal projects in python, and C, with some occasional C++ and JavaScript. This year, I have started to learn some Rust, and have done some basic web development. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, listening to music, skiing, playing video games, and procrastinating on actually commiting my code to github.</p>
